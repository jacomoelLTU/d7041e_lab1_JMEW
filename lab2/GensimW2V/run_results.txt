GensimW2V runs

5. Report the accuracy on TOEFL for all simulations :

The different simulations were run about 5 times, the percentage of the accuracy did not 
differ to much from whats documentetd below, simulations of higher dimensionalites were only
run 1 time due to the runningtime increase caused. 

Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 51.25% , dim = 50
Threshold ferq = 0.0055 Percentage of correct answers: 50.0% , dim = 50

Threshold ferq = 5.5e-05 Percentage of correct answers: 68.75% , dim = 100

Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 70.0% , dim = 150

Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 71.25% , dim = 200

Threshold ferq = 5.5e-05 Percentage of correct answers: 68.75% , dim 500
Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 72.5% , dim = 500

Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 50.0% , dim = 10 , run1
Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 52.5% , dim = 10 , run2
Threshold ferq = 0.00055 Percentage of correct answers: 50.0% , dim = 10 , run3

6. Elaborate how accuracy changes with the dimensionality :

The accuracy increases with the increase of the dimensionality paramater, higher dimensionalites
increases the models expressiveness and abillity to realise linguistic patterns in the text thus 
more complex semantic relationships between words will be more accuratly predicted.

This indicates that there is a trade-off between the choice of dimensionalites and computational
resources, one need to tune the parameters of the model to ahcive better results. This process
will be different depending on the data and the goal of what one are trying ahcieve with ones model.
This can be acomplished through testing and analyzing of the data set.

For the dataset and model provided the accuracy increase seems to deminish for dimensionalites around 
100.
